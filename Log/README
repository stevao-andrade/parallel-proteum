This directory contains log files related to the execution of the scripts.

The logs has been replaced by stdout print.

So, to active the logfiles, it's need to replace every statment into the scripts file  as shown below:

create a log file:

import logging

log.basicConfig(format="%(asctime)s %(message)s", datefmt="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S", level=logging.INFO)

replace the parts of the code with this kind of statment:

if verbose: print 'String'  -> log.info('String')
